# Data Structures and Algorithms - Udacity - Notes

## Arrays
ordered, with index

## Linked lists
ordered, no index, keep pointer/reference to next element
doubly linked lists (both next and previous)
null next if last

## Stacks
lifo
push - add element
pop - take element off
both constant time

## Queues
fifo
head - first(oldest) element
tail - last(newest) element
enqueue() - add element at tail
dequeue() - take element off the head
peek() - look at the head element but don't take it off

deque - double-ended queue (enqueue and dequeue on both ends)
can use deque as generalised stack or queue

priority queue 
* assign a priority on enqueue, dequeue element with highest priority
